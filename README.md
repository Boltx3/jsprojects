#100 jsprojects
I am coding 100 Javascript projects, examples, and showcases. This will be done in vanilla javascript, projects will be inspired by other repositories, tutorials and videos I've seen on the web. I am going to try to finish a project or commit changes daily. The end goal of this is to understand enough javascript to move onto learning react/vue, typescript.

2. Modal

3.  Funfacts
